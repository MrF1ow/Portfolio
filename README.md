You might be wondering: why does this website have *two* versions of the same person?
Well, something I noticed while browsing countless portfolio pages for inspiration was that they all focused on just one aspect of themselves: who they are as a software professional. Don’t get me wrong, that’s very important, but companies and people looking to hire are evaluating both the software and the person. And that’s how this idea was born.




This project uses:

- [**Vite**](https://vite.dev/) – for fast development with hot module replacement and optimized production builds.  
- [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) – for utility-first styling, allowing rapid, responsive design adjustments.  
- [**DaisyUI**](https://daisyui.com/docs/install/) – for prebuilt, customizable UI components built on Tailwind, speeding up the interface development.
