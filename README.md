# Portfolio Page – New (In Development)

A fresh, modern redesign of Ethan Flow's portfolio. This version focuses on a sleek, interactive experience with a personal touch and streamlined design.

This project uses:

- [**Vite**](https://vite.dev/) – for fast development with hot module replacement and optimized production builds.  
- [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) – for utility-first styling, allowing rapid, responsive design adjustments.  
- [**DaisyUI**](https://daisyui.com/docs/install/) – for prebuilt, customizable UI components built on Tailwind, speeding up the interface development.
